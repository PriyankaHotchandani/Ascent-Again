"AscentAgain" website for the hackathon 'HackViolet' hosted by The Association of Women in Computing at Virginia Tech

Our website is specifically aimed towards women in distress, to help them with questions like "What next?", "Where do I go from here on?", "How do I cope with this colossal amount of stress?", "How do I take care of myself and my family now?"

To answer these questions, we have services that help search jobs, seek therapy, and a forum to discuss issues and share stories/experiences. Along with these, our website also provides some general yet lesser-known facts about female empowerment laws in India and women helpline numbers. We have taken four cities into consideration namely Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore and have used real-time data.

Database files would be required for the smooth working of the project. Please include the database file hackvioletdatabase.sql.
